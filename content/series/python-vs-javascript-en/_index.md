title: Python vs Javascript
---

In this series of posts I will try to compare python and javascript. Personally I switch between them regularly and I am fed up with googling easy parts and differencies of each language, like how to append element into the list, or array ðŸ˜Š? It's time to write down some notes, so I can refer to them more easily and faster.
